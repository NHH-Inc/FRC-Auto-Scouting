"""The match roster, read off the broadcast scoreboard.

Doc 0 says `alliances` is what narrows bumper OCR to three candidates a side, and that a job whose
TBA lookup found nothing is still valid. That case is not rare -- the first real match analysed
had `alliances: null`, because TBA has no data for it -- and without a roster bumper OCR is an
open-vocabulary problem it cannot win. The graphic on screen already names all six teams, so it
is the fallback, and doc 0 already reserves `scoreboard_ocr` as a source for exactly this.

Two ideas do the work, and neither needs a per-venue crop region:

  * The alliance bar is the one place on screen where a wide band of saturated red sits directly
    beside a wide band of saturated blue. Finding that pair locates both cells, and which cell a
    number came from IS its alliance -- no guessing from left and right.

  * Inside a cell, the team numbers are the digits that do not change. The score changes, the
    timer changes, the ranking changes. Sampling frames across the match separates them with no
    knowledge of the layout at all.

Handing a whole cell to Tesseract does not work: the team logos beside each number are shapes it
tries to read, and the score is three times the height of the team numbers, so there is no
consistent line. Glyphs are isolated instead, grouped by the height they share, and each number is
read on its own -- a much easier question than reading a layout.
